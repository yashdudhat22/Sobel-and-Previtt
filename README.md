# Sobel-and-Previtt_IPMV-
The Sobel operator is a well-known edge detection method used in image processing. It detects the edges in an image by calculating the gradient of the image intensity at each pixel. The operator uses convolution with two distinct kernels to detect horizontal and vertical edges.

The Prewitt operator is an edge detection technique in image processing that highlights the edges by calculating the gradient of the image intensity. Similar to the Sobel operator, the Prewitt operator uses convolution with specific kernels to detect edges. It is particularly useful for detecting edges in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
